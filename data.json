Below is a taste of one of the many benefits a premium subscription gets you each week: a topic email. Within each topic email, we explain what the current week\u2019s topic is, how it can be leveraged, and why it\u2019s important for technical interviews. Going forward you'll receive one problem each day and we encourage you to do your best to solve it. Daily practice is important and doing a little bit each day helps to improve your progress over time. Without further ado, here\u2019s the info you should know about strings and we\u2019ll be sending you your first string problem at 9 AM ET.\r\nStrings, What are they?\r\nIn programming, strings are data types that store sequences of characters. Depending on the language you\u2019re using, strings may or may not be immutable. In Java specifically, strings are immutable. This is to help ensure things like security, synchronization, and caching.  Because strings are immutable, when you modify a string, it creates an entirely new string. This is important to know, especially during technical interviews, as repeatedly modifying a string could degrade your runtime. If you do need to constantly modify a string during an interview question, consider using a StringBuilder, which is mutable.\r\nString Methods to Know for Interviews\r\nStrings are arguably the most commonly used data type throughout programming, and as a result, will be used extensively during interviews. Whether the problem relates to strings directly and manipulating them, or you simply need to store intermediary information to solve the problem at hand, you should familiarize yourself with strings and their available methods. Some of the most common string methods you\u2019ll use during interviews are the following:\r\n.toCharArray()\r\nBy invoking .toCharArray() on a string, its character array representation will be returned. Converting a string to a character array can be helpful in scenarios where you need to modify characters within your string, for example swapping two characters.\r\nString abc = \"abc\";\r\nchar[] characters = abc.toCharArray();\r\nchar temp = characters[0];\r\ncharacters[0] = characters[2];\r\ncharacters[2] = temp;\r\n\r\n// prints \"cba\"\r\nSystem.out.println(new String(characters));\r\n.indexOf()\r\nInvoking indexOf() on a string and passing a character or a string as a parameter will return the index at which the specified character or string first occurs. This can be helpful in quickly determining whether or not a specific character or substring exists within the string in question. If the specified substring does not exist, .indexOf() will return -1.\r\nString computer = \"computer\";\r\n\r\n// index will store 0\r\nint index = computer.indexOf('c');\r\n\r\n// index will store -1\r\nindex = computer.indexOf('a');\r\n\r\n// index will store 3\r\nindex = computer.indexOf(\"puter\");\r\n.split()\r\nCalling split returns a string array, splitting the string by the specified delimiter. For example, calling .split(\u201c \u201c)  will split the string by a space. The split method can be useful for problems where you\u2019re required to parse a string or larger text before solving the problem.\r\nString name = \"The Daily Byte\"\r\n\r\n// words will contain [\"The\", \"Daily\", \"Byte\"]\r\nString[] words = name.split(\" \");\r\n\r\nIf you enjoyed this email and would like to continue receiving them each week, feel free to upgrade to a premium subscription here.

Fear ignorance.\r\n\ud83d\udc4b Welcome back to the Medium Newsletter\r\nIssue #224: your thoughts on the Great Barrington Declaration, and a useful quote\r\nHere are three pieces of practical wisdom to take with you this week:\r\nYour biggest fear should not be failure; it should be ignorance. In the words of Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth, the downfall of most organizations is \"widespread acceptance of the wrong idea (http://redirect.medium.systems/r--_qaSKpUc0?source=email-db17dc34be24-1733744478094-newsletter.v3-15f753907972-75888216b93f-----------------------b6bf26c9_5a48_4735_ba36_a58fa1559513--------bf3f56c7deec)\r\n\"\u200a-\u200amisinformed, overconfident assumptions that become so familiar they go unquestioned. This applies on a personal level, too. One way to combat it: seek out, encourage, and reward dissent.\r\nA singleminded passion might sustain you briefly, but when it flames out, as novelist and marketer Felicia C. Sullivan (https://medium.com/u/dcc7ed6948f1)\r\n recommends, think of your life as a series of rooms you can dip in and out of. Build a \"house of fulfillment (http://redirect.medium.systems/r-2LLMplOXdr?source=email-db17dc34be24-1733744478094-newsletter.v3-15f753907972-75888216b93f-----------------------b6bf26c9_5a48_4735_ba36_a58fa1559513--------bf3f56c7deec)\r\n\" that can sustain you over time, bigger than any individual pursuit.\r\nThe top 10 movies of 2024 are all sequels, if you count Wicked as a sequel. Reasons for this are cultural and economic: The rise of streaming makes studios more risk-averse because they can no longer earn long-tail revenue on VHS and DVD sales. More data = more obsession with data, and a preoccupation with replicating hits. Rebranding existing IP is cheap and nostalgia sells. Ask yourself: How often are you watching/reading/listening to stories that feel new and challenging v. stories that feel familiar? (Ted Gioia)\r\n\r\n- Harris Sockel\r\nAlso today: Your thoughts on the Great Barrington Declaration\r\nLast week, we sent a newsletter about the Great Barrington Declaration, a 2020 open letter by three epidemiologists arguing blanket Covid lockdowns would do more harm than good. Many of you responded thoughtfully, disagreeing or adding nuance to the conversation. We love nothing more than reasoned disagreement. Here are a few responses that stood out to us:\r\nIn retrospect, some of the premises laid down in the GDB actually hold true. There was an impact on mental health, and it was difficult to get access to general medical procedures due to the lockdown.\r\nThe term 'herd immunity' is usually misunderstood. As defined in the GBD, it implies a steady rate of infection (and cure), similar to what we see with influenza. But the general public took it to mean that we'll become immune to the corona virus, which can never happen as the virus always mutates. \r\n- S Chakraborty\r\nI get the point you make in this article, and generally agree with it\u200a-\u200aexcept that the pushback on the GBD wasn't overblown. The GBD made some claims that have been proven false, and the anti-vax, anti-shutdown, anti-public health political right immediately adopted a black-and-white approach, acting as if they knew what was right and wrong, and ignoring the fact that public health authorities were making the best decisions they could under circumstances of uncertainty. They dishonestly framed the issue in terms of good vs. evil, and that is what the pushback was against.\r\n\u200a-\u200aRobert Kantner\r\nFrankly, I can't see why you would want to elevate people with a track record of being wrong over those who have a track record of being right. Or how you would think you could justify doing so by saying 'well, there was a lot of fear and uncertainty at the time'. Surely that's all the more reason to back those who made good decisions despite the challenging circumstances? \r\n- Mark S\r\nYou strike the right tone of intellectual curiosity, neutrality, and just practical common sense. Something that has eroded in the last eight years. Nice to see an effort to stimulate healthy, informative dialogue rather than continue the campaign of painting those with a differing opinion as evil. \r\n\u200a-\u200aGpanah in an email to tips@medium.com\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf81 One more story: on giving\r\nSix years ago, Kristine Levine (https://medium.com/u/885e14633a5e)\r\n published a Medium essay (http://redirect.medium.systems/r-4uWLrl4hmc?source=email-db17dc34be24-1733744478094-newsletter.v3-15f753907972-75888216b93f-----------------------b6bf26c9_5a48_4735_ba36_a58fa1559513--------bf3f56c7deec)\r\n reflecting on the poverty and hunger she experienced as a child. Levine's mom was unemployed, and they rarely ate dinner. One night, they wandered the neighborhood, knocking on doors until a neighbor answered. She immediately packed up her entire dinner table and handed it to them. Levine has been thinking about that moment her entire life\u200a-\u200anot just because of what it meant to her and her mother, but because it contains a lesson that applies to so much in life. \"When you give the best you have to someone in need,\" Levine writes, \"it translates into something much deeper to the receiver.

Today: satellites burning up in the atmosphere could potentially alter the climate\u2014but we don\u2019t yet know how big a problem they pose.

From a rented jet, a team of researchers captured a satellite\u2019s last moments as it fell out of space and blazed into ash across the sky, using cameras and scientific equipment. Their hope was to gather priceless insights into the physical and chemical processes that occur when satellites burn up as they fall to Earth at the end of their missions.\r\n\r\nThis kind of study is growing more urgent. The number of satellites in the sky is rapidly rising\u2014with a tenfold increase forecast by the end of the decade. Letting these satellites burn up in the atmosphere at the end of their lives helps keep the quantity of space junk to a minimum. But doing so deposits satellite ash in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. This metallic ash could potentially alter the climate, and we don\u2019t yet know how serious the problem is likely to be.

Martin seems\r\nlike a good first step in that direction. You can call, text,\r\nemail or slack it and ask it to handle basic scheduling tasks.\r\nRight now, the additional friction required to get used to the UI\r\nwill probably dissuade all but the most enthusiastic early\r\nadopters. But once Martin can start reliably responding to\r\nemails, scheduling appointments, and summarizing our social media\r\nfeeds? Then we\u2019ll see a real human-computer interaction paradigm\r\nshift.\r\n\r\nSanjana Friedman ( https://www.producthunt.com/@sanjanaf )\r\n\r\nSanjana Friedman\r\nHead of Content @ Product Hunt ( https://www.producthunt.com/@sanjanaf )\r\n\r\nSleep as a service ( )\r\n\r\nRemy AI: ( https://www.producthunt.com/posts/remy-ai?utm_campaign=35832_2024-12-09&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=Daily+Digest&utm_term=editorial ) An AI sleep and recovery assistant\r\n\r\nThere's much to love about Remy's launch today. From the clever\r\nuse of an AI talking via its maker's comment to the ability to\r\npredict your melatonin and cortisol daily peaks. Remy seems like\r\na refreshing and well packaged take in a crowded space. My\r\nfavorite part? It started as a Telegram bot that evolved into a\r\nfull product based on community useage and feedback. In a world\r\nwhere folks are launching Telegram bots as products, this seems\r\nlike the right approach - test within a community first, then\r\nspin the bot out as a full product that offers more that what's\r\ncapable within Telegram. Now g2g, Remy is waiting to tuck me in\r\n\r\nGabe Perez ( https://www.producthunt.com/@gabe )\r\n\r\nGabe Perez\r\nHead of Product Curation @ Product Hunt ( https://www.producthunt.com/@gabe )\r\n\r\nCollaborative travel ( )\r\n\r\nAirmeet: ( https://www.producthunt.com/posts/airmeet-2?utm_campaign=35832_2024-12-09&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=Daily+Digest&utm_term=editorial ) Coliving on demand\r\n\r\nAirmeet feels like Airbnb\u2019s social cousin\u2014less about booking,\r\nmore about bonding. The idea? Turn dream stays into affordable\r\nrealities by teaming up with like-minded strangers. Foodies in\r\nSpain? Night owls in Bali? You pick the vibe, split the villa,\r\nand live the good life. But here\u2019s my question: Why not just use\r\nAirbnb and wrangle a group chat myself? I guess the magic here is\r\nthe curation\u2014finding people you\u2019d actually want to share a fridge\r\nwith. If it nails that, Airmeet could make solo travel a lot\r\nless, well, solo, and a lot more fun \u2014 especially for nomads.\r\n\r\nAaron O'Leary ( https://www.producthunt.com/@aaronoleary )\r\n\r\nAaron O'Leary\r\nContent @ Product Hunt ( https://www.producthunt.com/@aaronoleary )\r\n\r\nMonday, 9 December 2024\r\nYesterday's Top Products\r\n\r\n( https://www.producthunt.com/posts/martin-3?utm_campaign=35832_2024-12-09&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=Daily+Digest&utm_term=featured )\r\n\r\n1.
