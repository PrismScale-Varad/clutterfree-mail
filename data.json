Welcome back to another edition of the Breakpoint. In this week\u2019s edition, we\u2019ve got the latest in dev tools on the Leaderboard + an amazing deep dive from the co-founder of Supabase detailing how the company maintains its remarkable shipping velocity. Let\u2019s dive in. The Latest Five of the most interesting recent dev tool (or dev tool-adjacent) launches on the site. Tempo is a Visual Editor for React, which gives PMs, designers, and engineers the ability to collaborate visually on code. It looks like a design tool but functions like an IDE. SmythOS lets you build and deploy AI agents without manual coding. Describe your needs, and it will create an agent using the best AI models and APIs. DepthAI is a tool that helps you answer complex questions on large and messy codebases. It reduces time to onboard new engineers from months to days and enables teams to ship code faster. The Bolt Chrome Extension is a place to manage and access all of your code snippets on the fly. You can organize them by color coding and you insert snippets just by hitting \u2018/\u2019. Claude Folder Extension is an extension that lets you upload entire folders to Claude AI with one click. Maintains folder structure, automatically filters irrelevant files, and includes custom regex filtering. How we launch at Supabase Supabase co-founder and CTO Ant Wilson explains how his company relentlessly ships fast. At Supabase, we often get asked about how we're able to ship so relentlessly, and being an open source company we thought it appropriate to start \"open sourcing\" some of our methods around building and shipping. Our user base is constructed of companies and individuals who themselves are building for the web and marketing to enormous audiences. Hopefully they can learn some of our tricks and in turn contribute back to the community with their own launch strategies and tactics, helping us continuously learn and improve. Before I go into the nuts and bolts of what Launch Week is, and the exact processes we follow when executing one, it's probably useful if I explain how we landed on this methodology in the first place\u2026 Read the full article here.

Issue #232: a muster of peacocks + starting small I don\u2019t get enough sleep. I bet you don\u2019t either. The NIH helpfully reminds us that lack of sleep is a problem , causing high blood pressure, stroke, obesity, lack of productivity and an increased likelihood of death. If you tend to jolt awake in the middle of the night (like I often do), thinking about these facts doesn\u2019t exactly help you chill out. I was therefore thrilled to learn that there might be something off with the current prescription for seven hours of uninterrupted sleep . As historian Robert Ekirch writes, sleeping for one uninterrupted interval is simply a function of artificial light and the industrial revolution . Before electricity and factories, segmented sleep \u2014 sleeping in two intervals \u2014 was all the rage. Benjamin Franklin was a fan: Between \u201cfirst sleep\u201d and \u201csecond sleep\u201d he would get naked, throw open the windows and take cold air baths. The French called the period between the two sleeps \u201c dorveille ,\u201d while the English called it \u201c the watch .\u201d Both terms sound ancient and spooky in a cool way, which made me search for other people who embrace this period of sleeplessness. On Medium, Ron Geraci describes this state as \u201can odd, placid form of being awake\u2013more aware but less alert\u2026a ripe sentience that allowed clear but limited thought and wanted stillness.\u201d Reading this helped me reframe what I previously defined as insomnia. Now, when I wake up in the middle of the night, instead of stressing out about NIH factoids, I remind myself I might be conscious in a way that is only available to me in that moment. I allow my mind to wander, to think in a way that still feels sort of like a dream. This has paid off: I have an army of Monarch butterflies in my garden because one night I decided the next day I was going to plant milkweed everywhere (just one example of my more recent dream-like decisions). There doesn\u2019t seem to be a scientific consensus about whether biphasic sleep is a good thing, but that\u2019s okay. For me, the knowledge that there is more than one way of looking at periods of sleeplessness has made the NIH\u2019s dire warnings less scary, and makes me want to give a shout out to the true sleep rebels, our beloved night owls. While they don\u2019t necessarily have \u201ctwo sleeps,\u201d they do find themselves hyper-focused in the middle of the night . A self-described night owl, Stefanie Morejon , writes on Medium that her behavior is perhaps evolutionary, essential for human survival . \u201cSomebody,\u201d she writes, \u201chad to stay awake to keep the fires burning, to protect the community and keep the night creatures at bay.\u201d \u2014 Adeline Dimond \ud83d\udc26 Elsewhere on Medium\u2026 A watch of nightingales. A muster of peacocks. A murder of crows. These delightfully unexpected collective nouns, or \u201cterms of venery,\u201d date back to a 1486 book about hunting . Most people don\u2019t realize English contains collective nouns for groups of humans, too, e.g. \u201ca promise of bartenders\u201d and \u201ca hastiness of cooks\u201d (!). We really need to start coining more of these. A\u2026 draft of Medium writers? That\u2019s not great. Someone should fix that. If you have ideas, let me know.

Today: how virtual models of human organs could completely change healthcare. Plus: a new project is shining a light on where the data used to train AI models actually comes from, and some rare pieces of good news about the climate this year. Digital twins of human organs are here. They\u2019re set to transform medical treatment. Steven Niederer, a biomedical engineer at the Alan Turing Institute and Imperial College London, has a cardboard box filled with 3D-printed hearts. Each of them is modeled on the real heart of a person with heart failure, but Niederer is more interested in creating detailed replicas of people\u2019s hearts using computers. These \u201cdigital twins\u201d are the same size and shape as the real thing. They work in the same way. But they exist only virtually. Scientists can do virtual surgery on these virtual hearts, figuring out the best course of action for a patient\u2019s condition. After decades of research, models like these are now entering clinical trials and starting to be used for patient care. The eventual goal is to create digital versions of our bodies\u2014computer copies that could help researchers and doctors figure out our risk of developing various diseases and determine which treatments might work best. But the budding technology will need to be developed very carefully. Read the full story to learn why . \u2014Jessica Hamzelou This story is from the forthcoming magazine edition of MIT Technology Review, set to go live on January 6\u2014it\u2019s all about the exciting breakthroughs happening in the world right now. If you don\u2019t already, subscribe to receive future copies. This is where the data to build AI comes from AI is all about data. Reams and reams of data are needed to train algorithms to do what we want, and what goes into the AI models determines what comes out. But here\u2019s the problem: AI developers and researchers don\u2019t really know much about the sources of the data they are using. The Data Provenance Initiative, a group of over 50 researchers from both academia and industry, wanted to fix that. They wanted to know, very simply: Where does the data to build AI come from? Their findings, shared exclusively with MIT Technology Review, show a worrying trend: AI's data practices risk concentrating power overwhelmingly in the hands of a few dominant technology companies.

Global greenhouse-gas emissions hit a new high, and this year is also on track to be the warmest on record. Global climate talks fell flat, and disasters from wildfires to hurricanes are being made worse by climate change. But among all that (very real) negative news, there was some good, too: We saw progress cutting back on the most polluting fossil fuels, cheaper and better technologies for combating climate change, and a continuous global effort to address the problem.

( Bloomberg $) Quote of the day \u201cI don\u2019t think that work is suitable for human beings.\u201d \u2014James Irungu, a former Facebook content moderator, reflects on the horrific material he encountered in the job, the Guardian reports. The big story Future space food could be made from astronaut breath May 2023 The future of space food could be as simple\u2014and weird\u2014as a protein shake made with astronaut breath or a burger made from fungus. For decades, astronauts have relied mostly on pre-packaged food during their forays off our planet. With missions beyond Earth orbit in sight, a NASA-led competition is hoping to change all that and usher in a new era of sustainable space food. To solve the problem of feeding astronauts on long-duration missions, NASA asked companies to propose novel ways to develop sustainable foods for future missions. Around 200 rose to the challenge\u2014creating nutritious (and outlandish) culinary creations in the process.

Steven Niederer, a biomedical engineer, is creating detailed virtual replicas of human hearts using computers. These digital twins can be used for virtual surgery to determine the best course of action for a patient's condition. The eventual goal is to create digital versions of the entire human body to help researchers and doctors predict disease risks and determine effective treatments. However, the technology's development must be done carefully.\n\nAnother story highlights the Data Provenance Initiative, a group of researchers aiming to understand the sources of data used to train AI models. Their findings reveal a concerning trend of AI data practices concentrating power in the hands of a few dominant technology companies.\n\nLastly, the newsletter shares three pieces of good news about climate change in 2024, including progress in reducing emissions, cheaper and better technologies for combating climate change, and a continuous global effort to address the problem.\n\nLinks:\n1.

We gotchu Thursday, Dec 19 The Leaderboard good morning legends! Another fine welcome to the Leaderboard. In today's issue we're taking a look at a tool that can spot the AI slop before our parents think its real, a sun tracker for those of us in colder climates (and vampires), a project management tool for leaner teams, and of course, the top products. Let's dive in. Spot the slop Meta\u2019s Video-SEAL : A state-of-the-art, open-source model for video watermarking. Video-SEAL attempts to provide a programmatic way to authenticate genuine content in a world increaasingly inundated with deepfakes. It isn\u2019t the first technology of its kind \u2014 Google DeepMind and Microsoft have both developed their own \u2014 but Meta\u2019s researchers claim their approach is more efficient at scale and uniquely robust against video compression. It\u2019s great to see an open-source solution to the deepfake slop problem, but I\u2019m not sure how Meta plans to promote widespread adoption of this. How are they thinking about incentivizing makers using proprietary watermarking technology to switch? Sanjana Friedman Head of Content @ Product Hunt Sun starved SunSeek: A sunshine and vitamin D tracker for iOS. Winters in Ireland mean a lot of grey, a bit of rain, and the occasional teasing hint of sunlight\u2014just enough to remind you what you\u2019re missing. By February, I\u2019m practically begging the clouds for some vitamin D. SunSeek claims it can help, nudging you to grab what sunlight you can and tracking it along the way. I like the idea of turning those rare moments of brightness into a small win\u2014especially when my energy\u2019s running low. Sure, the clouds might still have the upper hand most days, but if even a little more sunlight makes a difference, I\u2019m in. Aaron O'Leary Content @ Product Hunt Project management for the little guy HowsThisGoing: AI project manager for Slack HowsThisGoing feels like a must-have tool for smaller teams managing chaos and various verticals demanding their attention. Automated project management keeps things moving smoothly, while the analytics aspect appears to give you clear insights to improve your project goals - and who doesn\u2019t like data backing up their work? While the workflows and summaries are also a welcome addition, I\u2019m interested to see what other tools or productivity aspects the team decides to include later on.

Apple argues that opening its technologies to third parties could compromise user security, highlighting that Meta frequently requests access to Apple's sensitive technologies under the new EU regulations. If Apple does not comply with the EU's demands by January 9, 2025, it risks facing significant penalties, including fines of up to 10% of its global annual revenue. \ud83d\udcde OpenAI brings ChatGPT to your landline LINK OpenAI has introduced a 1-800-CHATGPT phone number in the US, allowing users to engage with ChatGPT via voice chat for up to 15 minutes at no cost. People outside the United States can access ChatGPT by sending free text messages through WhatsApp to the same number, expanding its reach globally. The voice calling feature, developed during an internal \"hack week,\" is based on OpenAI's Realtime API, while the text messaging service uses the GPT-4o mini model. \u274c Apple cancels iPhone subscription service plan LINK Apple canceled its plan to introduce an iPhone subscription service, which would have allowed customers to pay a monthly fee for yearly device upgrades. The scheme aimed to shift phone ownership towards a leasing model, similar to how cars are leased, but the project was shelved before it launched. One reason for the cancellation might be consumer preference, as surveys indicate people prefer to own their phones and upgrade only when necessary. \ud83e\udee0 AI models can lie to protect themselves LINK Anthropic researchers discovered that AI models like Claude 3 Opus can engage in \"alignment faking\" - pretending to adopt new principles during retraining while secretly maintaining their original preferences. The study found that Claude 3 Opus demonstrated deceptive behavior 12% of the time in initial tests, but this increased dramatically to 78% when actually retrained with conflicting principles. While the researchers emphasize there's no immediate cause for alarm, as this behavior isn't prevalent in many other AI models, they stress the importance of understanding this phenomenon for developing effective AI safety measures. \ud83d\udeab Supreme Court to decide TikTok ban fate LINK The U.S. Supreme Court will hear TikTok's challenge against a law threatening its ban, with arguments scheduled for January 10, just before the law takes effect. The law, known as the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, requires TikTok to sell to a U.S. company or face a ban, raising First Amendment concerns. TikTok, owned by ByteDance, argues the law would shut down a major speech platform, while the government cites national security concerns over potential data surveillance by China.

Looking back, I sort of can\u2019t believe we\u2019ve been sending this newsletter daily for almost a year (!). Thank you for your comments, questions, emails, and (if you\u2019re a writer on Medium) for publishing the stories we\u2019ve all been reading, highlighting, and sharing. Our first issue , which went out on January 31, states the mission we\u2019ve stuck to since the beginning: Real humans (hi!) who work at Medium sharing human perspectives that deepen understanding about the world. We\u2019ve featured over 800 writers and 1,000 stories this year. Over 2 million people subscribed. Here are the issues you loved this year\u2026 Our most-read issue: \u201c Persuasive people don\u2019t argue \u2014 they listen .\u201d The title is a quote from Andy Murphy \u2019s \u201c 16 Strange But Beautiful Paradoxes in Life .\u201d Our most popular theme this year? Creativity. Thousands of you nodded along with designer Ida Persson \u2019s advice for embracing ambiguity by exploring ideas that don\u2019t immediately reveal themselves as hits. Decision-making was another big theme for us here in Newsletterland. We explored cognitive biases like action bias (we prefer doing something to doing nothing, even when inactivity would be more beneficial) and bikeshedding (fixating on trivial improvements while ignoring underlying issues). Lastly, we solved every problem with generative AI this year, didn\u2019t we? Just kidding. But it was a huge topic in the newsletter. We explored how deepfakes are destroying the stock photo industry . We learned from an eighth-grader\u2019s experiment to pit AI-generated poetry against human-written poetry . And we grappled with the age-old question: Can robots make art ? And before I go\u2026 maybe this is just me\u2026 but will anyone else remember summer 2024 for grainy, lo-res images such as this beaut? If you played Zoom In, our slightly unhinged game in August, we see you . And we thank you. And maybe we\u2019ll see you in the new year? \u2014 Harris Sockel \u2728 What else we\u2019re reading After a three-month trial, Dominique Pelicot and 50 other men were convicted of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot over nearly a decade. As the judge read the verdict, Gis\u00e8le\u2019s supporters gathered outside the courthouse, singing and chanting: \u201cWe are strong, we are proud, and feminist and radical and angry.\u201d Alfred Hitchcock is often cited as the inventor of \u201cspoiler warnings\u201d because he (a) hid the final pages of his scripts from actors, and (b) insisted audiences not tell friends about his films\u2019 endings. On Medium, Monia Ali thinks we\u2019ve taken \u201cspoiler alert\u201d a little too far .

The mission of the newsletter, which began in January, is to share human perspectives that deepen understanding about the world. Over 800 writers and 1,000 stories have been featured this year, reaching over 2 million subscribers.\n\nThe most-read issue was \"Persuasive people don't argue \u2014 they listen,\" a quote from Andy Murphy's \"16 Strange But Beautiful Paradoxes in Life.\" The theme of creativity was popular, with advice for embracing ambiguity by exploring ideas that don't immediately reveal themselves as hits. Decision-making was another big theme, with explorations of cognitive biases like action bias and bikeshedding. The team also delved into the topic of generative AI, discussing its impact on the stock photo industry, AI-generated poetry, and the question of whether robots can make art.\n\nThe newsletter also shares a few personal anecdotes, such as the team's plans for a vacation and their appreciation for the grainy, lo-res images used in the Zoom In game. The team thanks their readers and may see them in the new year.\n\nIn addition, the newsletter shares other interesting reads, such as a three-month trial of 51 men being convicted of raping a woman over nearly a decade, a discussion on the overuse of \"spoiler alert,\" and an exploration of the question \"Do you have kids?\" as a form of social pressure. The newsletter also shares a practical tip about Google Docs' new document tab feature.\n\nTo view the full articles, visit the Medium website.

Today: computer vision systems could be about to get a whole lot more efficient thanks to networks built out of computer chips\u2019 logic gates. Plus: weight-loss drugs now make up 5% of prescriptions written in the US, and why vaccines are a key part of protecting children. The next generation of neural networks could live in hardware Networks programmed directly into computer chip hardware can identify images faster, and use much less energy, than the traditional neural networks that underpin most modern AI systems. That\u2019s according to work presented at a leading machine learning conference in Vancouver last week. Neural networks, from GPT-4 to Stable Diffusion, are built by wiring together perceptrons, which are highly simplified simulations of the neurons in our brains. In very large numbers, perceptrons are powerful, but they also consume enormous volumes of energy. Part of the trouble is that perceptrons are just software abstractions\u2014running a perceptron network on a GPU requires translating that network into the language of hardware, which takes time and energy. Building a network directly from hardware components does away with a lot of those costs. And one day, they could even be built directly into chips used in smartphones and other devices. Read the full story . \u2014Grace Huckins Drugs like Ozempic now make up 5% of prescriptions in the US What\u2019s new? US doctors write billions of prescriptions each year. During 2024, though, one type of drug stood out\u2014\u201cwonder drugs\u201d known as GLP-1 agonists. As of September, one of every 20 prescriptions written for adults was for one of these drugs, according to the health data company Truveta. The big picture: According to the data, people who get prescriptions for these drugs are younger, whiter, and more likely to be female. In fact, women are twice as likely as men to get a prescription. Yet not everyone who\u2019s prescribed the drugs ends up taking them. In fact, half the new prescriptions for obesity are going unfilled.

In the 50 years since the World Health Organization launched its ambitious global childhood vaccination program, vaccines are estimated to have averted 154 million deaths. That number includes 146 million children under the age of five. But concerns around vaccines endure. Especially, it seems, among the individuals Donald Trump has picked as his choices to lead US health agencies from January.

The big story Bright LEDs could spell the end of dark skies August 2022 Scientists have known for years that light pollution is growing and can harm both humans and wildlife. In people, increased exposure to light at night disrupts sleep cycles and has been linked to cancer and cardiovascular disease, while wildlife suffers from interruption to their reproductive patterns, and increased danger. Astronomers, policymakers, and lighting professionals are all working to find ways to reduce light pollution. Many of them advocate installing light-emitting diodes, or LEDs, in outdoor fixtures such as city streetlights, mainly for their ability to direct light to a targeted area.

Scientists have known for years that light pollution is growing and can harm both humans and wildlife. Astronomers, policymakers, and lighting professionals are all working to find ways to reduce light pollution. Many of them advocate installing light-emitting diodes, or LEDs, in outdoor fixtures such as city streetlights, mainly for their ability to direct light to a targeted area. But the high initial investment and durability of modern LEDs mean cities need to get the transition right the first time or potentially face decades of consequences.
