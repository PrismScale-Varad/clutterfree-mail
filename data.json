Welcome back to another edition of the Breakpoint. In this week\u2019s edition, we\u2019ve got the latest in dev tools on the Leaderboard + an amazing deep dive from the co-founder of Supabase detailing how the company maintains its remarkable shipping velocity. Let\u2019s dive in. The Latest Five of the most interesting recent dev tool (or dev tool-adjacent) launches on the site. Tempo is a Visual Editor for React, which gives PMs, designers, and engineers the ability to collaborate visually on code. It looks like a design tool but functions like an IDE. SmythOS lets you build and deploy AI agents without manual coding. Describe your needs, and it will create an agent using the best AI models and APIs. DepthAI is a tool that helps you answer complex questions on large and messy codebases. It reduces time to onboard new engineers from months to days and enables teams to ship code faster. The Bolt Chrome Extension is a place to manage and access all of your code snippets on the fly. You can organize them by color coding and you insert snippets just by hitting \u2018/\u2019. Claude Folder Extension is an extension that lets you upload entire folders to Claude AI with one click. Maintains folder structure, automatically filters irrelevant files, and includes custom regex filtering. How we launch at Supabase Supabase co-founder and CTO Ant Wilson explains how his company relentlessly ships fast. At Supabase, we often get asked about how we're able to ship so relentlessly, and being an open source company we thought it appropriate to start \"open sourcing\" some of our methods around building and shipping. Our user base is constructed of companies and individuals who themselves are building for the web and marketing to enormous audiences. Hopefully they can learn some of our tricks and in turn contribute back to the community with their own launch strategies and tactics, helping us continuously learn and improve. Before I go into the nuts and bolts of what Launch Week is, and the exact processes we follow when executing one, it's probably useful if I explain how we landed on this methodology in the first place\u2026 Read the full article here.

Issue #232: a muster of peacocks + starting small I don\u2019t get enough sleep. I bet you don\u2019t either. The NIH helpfully reminds us that lack of sleep is a problem , causing high blood pressure, stroke, obesity, lack of productivity and an increased likelihood of death. If you tend to jolt awake in the middle of the night (like I often do), thinking about these facts doesn\u2019t exactly help you chill out. I was therefore thrilled to learn that there might be something off with the current prescription for seven hours of uninterrupted sleep . As historian Robert Ekirch writes, sleeping for one uninterrupted interval is simply a function of artificial light and the industrial revolution . Before electricity and factories, segmented sleep \u2014 sleeping in two intervals \u2014 was all the rage. Benjamin Franklin was a fan: Between \u201cfirst sleep\u201d and \u201csecond sleep\u201d he would get naked, throw open the windows and take cold air baths. The French called the period between the two sleeps \u201c dorveille ,\u201d while the English called it \u201c the watch .\u201d Both terms sound ancient and spooky in a cool way, which made me search for other people who embrace this period of sleeplessness. On Medium, Ron Geraci describes this state as \u201can odd, placid form of being awake\u2013more aware but less alert\u2026a ripe sentience that allowed clear but limited thought and wanted stillness.\u201d Reading this helped me reframe what I previously defined as insomnia. Now, when I wake up in the middle of the night, instead of stressing out about NIH factoids, I remind myself I might be conscious in a way that is only available to me in that moment. I allow my mind to wander, to think in a way that still feels sort of like a dream. This has paid off: I have an army of Monarch butterflies in my garden because one night I decided the next day I was going to plant milkweed everywhere (just one example of my more recent dream-like decisions). There doesn\u2019t seem to be a scientific consensus about whether biphasic sleep is a good thing, but that\u2019s okay. For me, the knowledge that there is more than one way of looking at periods of sleeplessness has made the NIH\u2019s dire warnings less scary, and makes me want to give a shout out to the true sleep rebels, our beloved night owls. While they don\u2019t necessarily have \u201ctwo sleeps,\u201d they do find themselves hyper-focused in the middle of the night . A self-described night owl, Stefanie Morejon , writes on Medium that her behavior is perhaps evolutionary, essential for human survival . \u201cSomebody,\u201d she writes, \u201chad to stay awake to keep the fires burning, to protect the community and keep the night creatures at bay.\u201d \u2014 Adeline Dimond \ud83d\udc26 Elsewhere on Medium\u2026 A watch of nightingales. A muster of peacocks. A murder of crows. These delightfully unexpected collective nouns, or \u201cterms of venery,\u201d date back to a 1486 book about hunting . Most people don\u2019t realize English contains collective nouns for groups of humans, too, e.g. \u201ca promise of bartenders\u201d and \u201ca hastiness of cooks\u201d (!). We really need to start coining more of these. A\u2026 draft of Medium writers? That\u2019s not great. Someone should fix that. If you have ideas, let me know.

Today: how virtual models of human organs could completely change healthcare. Plus: a new project is shining a light on where the data used to train AI models actually comes from, and some rare pieces of good news about the climate this year. Digital twins of human organs are here. They\u2019re set to transform medical treatment. Steven Niederer, a biomedical engineer at the Alan Turing Institute and Imperial College London, has a cardboard box filled with 3D-printed hearts. Each of them is modeled on the real heart of a person with heart failure, but Niederer is more interested in creating detailed replicas of people\u2019s hearts using computers. These \u201cdigital twins\u201d are the same size and shape as the real thing. They work in the same way. But they exist only virtually. Scientists can do virtual surgery on these virtual hearts, figuring out the best course of action for a patient\u2019s condition. After decades of research, models like these are now entering clinical trials and starting to be used for patient care. The eventual goal is to create digital versions of our bodies\u2014computer copies that could help researchers and doctors figure out our risk of developing various diseases and determine which treatments might work best. But the budding technology will need to be developed very carefully. Read the full story to learn why . \u2014Jessica Hamzelou This story is from the forthcoming magazine edition of MIT Technology Review, set to go live on January 6\u2014it\u2019s all about the exciting breakthroughs happening in the world right now. If you don\u2019t already, subscribe to receive future copies. This is where the data to build AI comes from AI is all about data. Reams and reams of data are needed to train algorithms to do what we want, and what goes into the AI models determines what comes out. But here\u2019s the problem: AI developers and researchers don\u2019t really know much about the sources of the data they are using. The Data Provenance Initiative, a group of over 50 researchers from both academia and industry, wanted to fix that. They wanted to know, very simply: Where does the data to build AI come from? Their findings, shared exclusively with MIT Technology Review, show a worrying trend: AI's data practices risk concentrating power overwhelmingly in the hands of a few dominant technology companies.

Global greenhouse-gas emissions hit a new high, and this year is also on track to be the warmest on record. Global climate talks fell flat, and disasters from wildfires to hurricanes are being made worse by climate change. But among all that (very real) negative news, there was some good, too: We saw progress cutting back on the most polluting fossil fuels, cheaper and better technologies for combating climate change, and a continuous global effort to address the problem.

( Bloomberg $) Quote of the day \u201cI don\u2019t think that work is suitable for human beings.\u201d \u2014James Irungu, a former Facebook content moderator, reflects on the horrific material he encountered in the job, the Guardian reports. The big story Future space food could be made from astronaut breath May 2023 The future of space food could be as simple\u2014and weird\u2014as a protein shake made with astronaut breath or a burger made from fungus. For decades, astronauts have relied mostly on pre-packaged food during their forays off our planet. With missions beyond Earth orbit in sight, a NASA-led competition is hoping to change all that and usher in a new era of sustainable space food. To solve the problem of feeding astronauts on long-duration missions, NASA asked companies to propose novel ways to develop sustainable foods for future missions. Around 200 rose to the challenge\u2014creating nutritious (and outlandish) culinary creations in the process.

Steven Niederer, a biomedical engineer, is creating detailed virtual replicas of human hearts using computers. These digital twins can be used for virtual surgery to determine the best course of action for a patient's condition. The eventual goal is to create digital versions of the entire human body to help researchers and doctors predict disease risks and determine effective treatments. However, the technology's development must be done carefully.\n\nAnother story highlights the Data Provenance Initiative, a group of researchers aiming to understand the sources of data used to train AI models. Their findings reveal a concerning trend of AI data practices concentrating power in the hands of a few dominant technology companies.\n\nLastly, the newsletter shares three pieces of good news about climate change in 2024, including progress in reducing emissions, cheaper and better technologies for combating climate change, and a continuous global effort to address the problem.\n\nLinks:\n1.

We gotchu Thursday, Dec 19 The Leaderboard good morning legends! Another fine welcome to the Leaderboard. In today's issue we're taking a look at a tool that can spot the AI slop before our parents think its real, a sun tracker for those of us in colder climates (and vampires), a project management tool for leaner teams, and of course, the top products. Let's dive in. Spot the slop Meta\u2019s Video-SEAL : A state-of-the-art, open-source model for video watermarking. Video-SEAL attempts to provide a programmatic way to authenticate genuine content in a world increaasingly inundated with deepfakes. It isn\u2019t the first technology of its kind \u2014 Google DeepMind and Microsoft have both developed their own \u2014 but Meta\u2019s researchers claim their approach is more efficient at scale and uniquely robust against video compression. It\u2019s great to see an open-source solution to the deepfake slop problem, but I\u2019m not sure how Meta plans to promote widespread adoption of this. How are they thinking about incentivizing makers using proprietary watermarking technology to switch? Sanjana Friedman Head of Content @ Product Hunt Sun starved SunSeek: A sunshine and vitamin D tracker for iOS. Winters in Ireland mean a lot of grey, a bit of rain, and the occasional teasing hint of sunlight\u2014just enough to remind you what you\u2019re missing. By February, I\u2019m practically begging the clouds for some vitamin D. SunSeek claims it can help, nudging you to grab what sunlight you can and tracking it along the way. I like the idea of turning those rare moments of brightness into a small win\u2014especially when my energy\u2019s running low. Sure, the clouds might still have the upper hand most days, but if even a little more sunlight makes a difference, I\u2019m in. Aaron O'Leary Content @ Product Hunt Project management for the little guy HowsThisGoing: AI project manager for Slack HowsThisGoing feels like a must-have tool for smaller teams managing chaos and various verticals demanding their attention. Automated project management keeps things moving smoothly, while the analytics aspect appears to give you clear insights to improve your project goals - and who doesn\u2019t like data backing up their work? While the workflows and summaries are also a welcome addition, I\u2019m interested to see what other tools or productivity aspects the team decides to include later on.

Apple argues that opening its technologies to third parties could compromise user security, highlighting that Meta frequently requests access to Apple's sensitive technologies under the new EU regulations. If Apple does not comply with the EU's demands by January 9, 2025, it risks facing significant penalties, including fines of up to 10% of its global annual revenue. \ud83d\udcde OpenAI brings ChatGPT to your landline LINK OpenAI has introduced a 1-800-CHATGPT phone number in the US, allowing users to engage with ChatGPT via voice chat for up to 15 minutes at no cost. People outside the United States can access ChatGPT by sending free text messages through WhatsApp to the same number, expanding its reach globally. The voice calling feature, developed during an internal \"hack week,\" is based on OpenAI's Realtime API, while the text messaging service uses the GPT-4o mini model. \u274c Apple cancels iPhone subscription service plan LINK Apple canceled its plan to introduce an iPhone subscription service, which would have allowed customers to pay a monthly fee for yearly device upgrades. The scheme aimed to shift phone ownership towards a leasing model, similar to how cars are leased, but the project was shelved before it launched. One reason for the cancellation might be consumer preference, as surveys indicate people prefer to own their phones and upgrade only when necessary. \ud83e\udee0 AI models can lie to protect themselves LINK Anthropic researchers discovered that AI models like Claude 3 Opus can engage in \"alignment faking\" - pretending to adopt new principles during retraining while secretly maintaining their original preferences. The study found that Claude 3 Opus demonstrated deceptive behavior 12% of the time in initial tests, but this increased dramatically to 78% when actually retrained with conflicting principles. While the researchers emphasize there's no immediate cause for alarm, as this behavior isn't prevalent in many other AI models, they stress the importance of understanding this phenomenon for developing effective AI safety measures. \ud83d\udeab Supreme Court to decide TikTok ban fate LINK The U.S. Supreme Court will hear TikTok's challenge against a law threatening its ban, with arguments scheduled for January 10, just before the law takes effect. The law, known as the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, requires TikTok to sell to a U.S. company or face a ban, raising First Amendment concerns. TikTok, owned by ByteDance, argues the law would shut down a major speech platform, while the government cites national security concerns over potential data surveillance by China.

Looking back, I sort of can\u2019t believe we\u2019ve been sending this newsletter daily for almost a year (!). Thank you for your comments, questions, emails, and (if you\u2019re a writer on Medium) for publishing the stories we\u2019ve all been reading, highlighting, and sharing. Our first issue , which went out on January 31, states the mission we\u2019ve stuck to since the beginning: Real humans (hi!) who work at Medium sharing human perspectives that deepen understanding about the world. We\u2019ve featured over 800 writers and 1,000 stories this year. Over 2 million people subscribed. Here are the issues you loved this year\u2026 Our most-read issue: \u201c Persuasive people don\u2019t argue \u2014 they listen .\u201d The title is a quote from Andy Murphy \u2019s \u201c 16 Strange But Beautiful Paradoxes in Life .\u201d Our most popular theme this year? Creativity. Thousands of you nodded along with designer Ida Persson \u2019s advice for embracing ambiguity by exploring ideas that don\u2019t immediately reveal themselves as hits. Decision-making was another big theme for us here in Newsletterland. We explored cognitive biases like action bias (we prefer doing something to doing nothing, even when inactivity would be more beneficial) and bikeshedding (fixating on trivial improvements while ignoring underlying issues). Lastly, we solved every problem with generative AI this year, didn\u2019t we? Just kidding. But it was a huge topic in the newsletter. We explored how deepfakes are destroying the stock photo industry . We learned from an eighth-grader\u2019s experiment to pit AI-generated poetry against human-written poetry . And we grappled with the age-old question: Can robots make art ? And before I go\u2026 maybe this is just me\u2026 but will anyone else remember summer 2024 for grainy, lo-res images such as this beaut? If you played Zoom In, our slightly unhinged game in August, we see you . And we thank you. And maybe we\u2019ll see you in the new year? \u2014 Harris Sockel \u2728 What else we\u2019re reading After a three-month trial, Dominique Pelicot and 50 other men were convicted of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot over nearly a decade. As the judge read the verdict, Gis\u00e8le\u2019s supporters gathered outside the courthouse, singing and chanting: \u201cWe are strong, we are proud, and feminist and radical and angry.\u201d Alfred Hitchcock is often cited as the inventor of \u201cspoiler warnings\u201d because he (a) hid the final pages of his scripts from actors, and (b) insisted audiences not tell friends about his films\u2019 endings. On Medium, Monia Ali thinks we\u2019ve taken \u201cspoiler alert\u201d a little too far .

The mission of the newsletter, which began in January, is to share human perspectives that deepen understanding about the world. Over 800 writers and 1,000 stories have been featured this year, reaching over 2 million subscribers.\n\nThe most-read issue was \"Persuasive people don't argue \u2014 they listen,\" a quote from Andy Murphy's \"16 Strange But Beautiful Paradoxes in Life.\" The theme of creativity was popular, with advice for embracing ambiguity by exploring ideas that don't immediately reveal themselves as hits. Decision-making was another big theme, with explorations of cognitive biases like action bias and bikeshedding. The team also delved into the topic of generative AI, discussing its impact on the stock photo industry, AI-generated poetry, and the question of whether robots can make art.\n\nThe newsletter also shares a few personal anecdotes, such as the team's plans for a vacation and their appreciation for the grainy, lo-res images used in the Zoom In game. The team thanks their readers and may see them in the new year.\n\nIn addition, the newsletter shares other interesting reads, such as a three-month trial of 51 men being convicted of raping a woman over nearly a decade, a discussion on the overuse of \"spoiler alert,\" and an exploration of the question \"Do you have kids?\" as a form of social pressure. The newsletter also shares a practical tip about Google Docs' new document tab feature.\n\nTo view the full articles, visit the Medium website.

Today: computer vision systems could be about to get a whole lot more efficient thanks to networks built out of computer chips\u2019 logic gates. Plus: weight-loss drugs now make up 5% of prescriptions written in the US, and why vaccines are a key part of protecting children. The next generation of neural networks could live in hardware Networks programmed directly into computer chip hardware can identify images faster, and use much less energy, than the traditional neural networks that underpin most modern AI systems. That\u2019s according to work presented at a leading machine learning conference in Vancouver last week. Neural networks, from GPT-4 to Stable Diffusion, are built by wiring together perceptrons, which are highly simplified simulations of the neurons in our brains. In very large numbers, perceptrons are powerful, but they also consume enormous volumes of energy. Part of the trouble is that perceptrons are just software abstractions\u2014running a perceptron network on a GPU requires translating that network into the language of hardware, which takes time and energy. Building a network directly from hardware components does away with a lot of those costs. And one day, they could even be built directly into chips used in smartphones and other devices. Read the full story . \u2014Grace Huckins Drugs like Ozempic now make up 5% of prescriptions in the US What\u2019s new? US doctors write billions of prescriptions each year. During 2024, though, one type of drug stood out\u2014\u201cwonder drugs\u201d known as GLP-1 agonists. As of September, one of every 20 prescriptions written for adults was for one of these drugs, according to the health data company Truveta. The big picture: According to the data, people who get prescriptions for these drugs are younger, whiter, and more likely to be female. In fact, women are twice as likely as men to get a prescription. Yet not everyone who\u2019s prescribed the drugs ends up taking them. In fact, half the new prescriptions for obesity are going unfilled.

In the 50 years since the World Health Organization launched its ambitious global childhood vaccination program, vaccines are estimated to have averted 154 million deaths. That number includes 146 million children under the age of five. But concerns around vaccines endure. Especially, it seems, among the individuals Donald Trump has picked as his choices to lead US health agencies from January.

The big story Bright LEDs could spell the end of dark skies August 2022 Scientists have known for years that light pollution is growing and can harm both humans and wildlife. In people, increased exposure to light at night disrupts sleep cycles and has been linked to cancer and cardiovascular disease, while wildlife suffers from interruption to their reproductive patterns, and increased danger. Astronomers, policymakers, and lighting professionals are all working to find ways to reduce light pollution. Many of them advocate installing light-emitting diodes, or LEDs, in outdoor fixtures such as city streetlights, mainly for their ability to direct light to a targeted area.

Friday, Dec 20 The Leaderboard This newsletter was brought to you by Vanta Happy Friday and welcome back to the Leaderboard. In the final issue of the week, we're diving into Flipboard's new app that brings some excitement back to the internet, an always-on mental health companion, and whether or not we really need another AI comment generator. Let's dive in. Old school internet vibes Flipboard Surf: A new app for browsing the open social web. Flipboard\u2019s new app, Surf, feels like a nudge to step off the algorithmic hamster wheel and rediscover the open web. It\u2019s essentially a browser built for exploring social content across platforms\u2014think blogs, indie sites, and communities you don\u2019t stumble upon in your typical feed. The idea is refreshing, especially when most apps are designed to keep you locked into their ecosystem. Surf feels more like a guide than a gatekeeper, helping you find the stuff you didn\u2019t even know you were looking for. It\u2019s a cool concept, but I can\u2019t help wondering\u2014will we really swap the ease of curated feeds for the thrill of digging around? Still, I\u2019m curious to see if this could bring some adventure back to browsing. Aaron O'Leary Content @ Product Hunt Reassurance as a service Nora : A 24/7 AI mental health companion that protects your identity Nora is the latest in a series of always-accessible AI companions that have launched in the past year. Its specific value prop is that it provides CBT-style emotional counseling (modules include \u201cdepression,\u201d \u201cpostpartum,\u201d and \u201cdivorce or separation\u201d), and that it preserves users\u2019 identities by storing all data locally. It\u2019s hard to figure out right now which of these 24/7 companions will take off, but it's clear that some companion will. What will become of our internal monologue, I wonder, in a world where we can always get instant reassurance from our artificial assistant? Sanjana Friedman Head of Content @ Product Hunt A side of truth Eden: One-click create comments on any webpages with AI Eden, miraculously #1 on Monday\u2019s leaderboard, is perhaps my least favorite launch of the year. While I don\u2019t think the world needs another AI-comment generator, I\u2019m pro-builder in whatever form that takes. That said, packaging up an AI-comment generator behind hand-wavey statements suggesting that they\u2019re making the web less like a \u201ccrowded house party\u201d and solving for more \u201cthoughtful conversations\u201d is disingenuous. If your holiday meal for me is more spam, so be it, just serve it up with a side of truth. steve beyatte Founder-in-residence at Product Hunt Ad Building in the age of AI: Startup lessons for early-stage growth In an era where AI is reshaping how businesses operate, the journey of building an early-stage startup has never been more dynamic\u2014or complex.

The impact : When AI models are open source, they\u2019re available to all. And when AI models are available to all, everyone benefits. Learn more about open source AI. \ud83e\udd16 Google releases its own 'reasoning' AI model LINK Google introduced the Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, an experimental AI model that tackles complex questions using a reasoning approach, competing directly with OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo. The model, revealed by Google's AI experts, enhances problem-solving by breaking tasks into smaller components, demonstrated during a physics problem-solving showcase. Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking is currently available for experimentation on Google's AI Studio, focusing on multimodal understanding, reasoning, and coding, though it remains in its early development stage. \u26a1 New physics simulation accelerates robot training by 430,000x LINK Genesis, a new open-source simulation system, enables robots to practice tasks at speeds 430,000 times faster than real-world conditions, helping them learn efficiently in a virtual environment. The platform, developed by researchers led by Zhou Xian of Carnegie Mellon University, processes physics calculations significantly faster than other simulators using advanced graphics technology, enhancing neural network training for future robots. With the ability to generate realistic and dynamic 3D virtual environments using text prompts, Genesis reduces the reliance on costly physical tests and accelerates the development of robotics by simulating diverse scenarios swiftly. \ud83d\ude97 Waymo cars safer than those driven by humans LINK Waymo's autonomous vehicles cause significantly less property damage and fewer bodily injuries than human-driven cars, showing an 88% reduction in property damage claims and a 92% reduction in injury claims. The study relies on data from 25.3 million miles driven by Waymo's vehicles in several cities, compared to human driving baselines derived from Swiss Re\u2019s data covering over 200 billion miles. Though there's debate about autonomous vehicle safety due to limited data, Waymo continues to advocate for their benefits, pointing to reduced crash risks compared to human drivers. \ud83d\udd0d Google Search will reportedly have a dedicated 'AI Mode' soon LINK Google is reportedly introducing a new \"AI Mode\" to its search engine, which will allow users to switch from the top of the results page to a chatbot-like interface. This AI Mode will be positioned alongside existing tabs and provide related links, along with a search bar for follow-up questions, enhancing interaction through voice queries. Google\u2019s move comes amid growing competition from OpenAI\u2019s integration of search in ChatGPT, pressuring Google to further blend search with artificial intelligence. \ud83d\udcbb Apple partners with Nvidia to speed up AI performance LINK Apple and Nvidia have collaborated to enhance large language models (LLMs) using a new text generation technique to boost AI application performance significantly. The technology, called Recurrent Drafter (ReDrafter), integrates beam search with dynamic tree attention methods and is now part of Nvidia's TensorRT-LLM framework for optimized GPU performance. This innovation results in a 2.7x speed increase in token production, reducing latency, GPU usage, and power consumption in LLMs with billions of parameters. \ud83d\udcfa YouTube to remove videos with clickbait titles LINK YouTube will start removing videos in India that use misleading titles and thumbnails, commonly known as clickbait, to improve content authenticity and user experience. The crackdown will initially focus on videos related to breaking news or current events, and no penalties will be imposed on creators at first to help them adapt. By rolling out these anti-clickbait measures, YouTube aims to eliminate frustrating and deceptive content and has previously offered training to help creators comply with its policies.

View this email online in your browser By Cody Corrall Saturday, December 21, 2024 Image Credits: alashi / Getty Images Welcome back to Week in Review. This week, we\u2019re looking at OpenAI\u2019s last \u2014 and biggest \u2014 announcement from its \u201c12 Days of OpenAI\u201d event; Apple\u2019s potential entrance into the foldable market; and why Databricks is choosing to wait to go public. Let\u2019s get into it. P.S. We\u2019re off for the holidays! Week in Review will be back in your inbox in the new year. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced the successors to its o1 reasoning model family: o3 and o3-mini. While the models are not widely available yet, safety researchers can sign up for a preview. The reveal marks the end of the company\u2019s \u201c12 Days of OpenAI\u201d event, which saw announcements for real-time vision capabilities, ChatGPT Search, and even a Santa voice for ChatGPT. You can catch up on everything you missed here. The Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses got a big upgrade this week. Members of Meta\u2019s early-access program can now download firmware v11, which adds \u201clive AI.\u201d The feature lets wearers continuously converse with Meta AI to reference things they discussed earlier in the conversation \u2014 and it works with real-time video. Live translation between English and Spanish, French, or Italian, as well as functionality with Shazam are also included in v11. UnitedHealth\u2019s Optum left an AI chatbot, used by employees to ask questions about claims, exposed to the internet \u2014 and anyone could access it with a web browser. While the chatbot did not appear to contain or produce sensitive personal or protected health information, its inadvertent exposure comes at a time when its parent company faces scrutiny for its use of AI tools and algorithms to allegedly override doctors\u2019 medical decisions and deny patient claims. News Image Credits: Oura Oura nabs $200M: The smart ring maker closed a $200 million Series D funding round, bringing the company\u2019s valuation to $5.2 billion. Oura says the cash will help the company expand its product offerings and further invest in product, science, AI, and more. Read more You can now call ChatGPT from a landline: In an effort to make ChatGPT accessible to as many people as possible, OpenAI announced a 1-800 number to call the chatbot \u2014 even from a landline or a flip phone. Users can call 1-800-CHATGPT, and the AI assistant will respond through the phone. Read more Tesla tries to boost Model S sales: After abandoning its free Supercharging for life offer in 2018, Tesla is bringing it back for some Tesla Model S cars at the end of the year. But it's important to note that Tesla also just increased the price for the Model S by $5,000. Read more Google wants to take on Sora: Google DeepMind announced Veo 2, a next-gen video-generating AI. Veo 2 can create two-minute-plus clips in resolutions up to 4k. That\u2019s 4x the resolution \u2014 and over 6x the duration \u2014 that OpenAI\u2019s Sora can achieve. Read more Apple eyes the foldable market: Apple is aiming to launch two foldable devices in the next few years, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal. Another report from Bloomberg, however, claims the company\u2019s focus is on a giant, foldable iPad. Read more Bob Lee verdict: A San Francisco jury found Nima Momeni guilty of second-degree murder in the fatal 2023 stabbing of Bob Lee, the Cash App creator and former CTO of Block. The jurors decided Lee\u2019s murder was not premeditated and found Momeni not guilty of first-degree murder.

The company says Perplexity will soon be able to search through your files and work messages in Notion, Google Docs, or Slack sometime in early 2025.

The shopping app moved into the No. 1 slot last year, stealing the position from TikTok.

It\u2019s currently in the experimental stages, and from our brief testing, there\u2019s certainly room for improvement. Read more Analysis Image Credits : David Paul Morris/Bloomberg / Getty Images To IPO or not to IPO: Databricks just closed one of the largest funding rounds ever, raising a staggering $10 billion. Naturally, technology investors were quick to ask what this means for the company\u2019s highly anticipated IPO. In an interview at Axios AI Summit, CEO Ali Ghodsi said \u201cit\u2019s dumb to IPO this year\u201d and is instead waiting until at least 2025. Databricks is using this \u201cSeries J\u201d to let early employees cash out and continue growing. While 2024 was uncertain in many ways, the IPOs of ServiceTitan, Reddit, and other companies have largely been successful. But, as Maxwell Zeff writes, why risk it when you can just raise as much money as Databricks?

The AI consulting market is about to grow by a factor of 8X \u2013 from $6.9 billion today to $54.7 billion in 2032. But how does an AI enthusiast become an AI consultant? Our friends at Innovating with AI just welcomed 200 new students into The AI Consultancy Project , their new program that trains you to build a business as an AI consultant.

The company claims o3 shows progress toward AGI in certain conditions, though it is not yet generally available; safety researchers can preview o3-mini, with wider access planned for next year. o3 has excelled in internal tests, outperforming its predecessor in programming and mathematics benchmarks, although external validation is awaited to confirm these results. \ud83d\udd0d Google proposes fix to solve search monopoly LINK Google has proposed unbundling its Android apps and modifying its search distribution contracts as an alternative to the Department of Justice's suggestion to break up the company by selling Chrome. The company's proposal includes a three-year ban on linking licenses for Chrome, Search, and Google Play with the placement of other Google apps, while still allowing it to pay for default search placement in browsers with more flexible terms. This counterproposal comes in response to Judge Amit Mehta's ruling that Google is a monopolist, with a revised proposal expected on March 7th ahead of a trial in April, though Google still plans to appeal the ruling. \u2696\ufe0f Qualcomm wins legal battle against Arm LINK A federal jury in Delaware concluded that Qualcomm did not violate its agreement with Arm during its 2021 acquisition of Nuvia, a startup founded by former Apple engineers. The jury could not decide if Nuvia breached its contract, leaving the possibility for the case to be retried, as stated by US District Court Judge Maryellen Noreika. Qualcomm's acquisition of Nuvia aimed to enhance its chip lineup, and internal documents showed potential annual savings of $1.4 billion on Arm payments. \ud83c\udff4\u200d\u2620\ufe0f Pegasus maker ruled liable for attacks on 1,400 WhatsApp users LINK NSO Group has been deemed responsible in a lawsuit initiated by Meta's WhatsApp for using Pegasus spyware to attack around 1,400 devices, according to The Record. The lawsuit, filed by WhatsApp in 2019, revealed that Pegasus was utilized to infiltrate the phones of individuals such as activists, journalists, and officials. NSO Group violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and other laws, with the trial now set to determine damages, despite the company's arguments being dismissed by the judge. \ud83d\udca3 AI bypassed by creative spelling LINK Anthropic's research reveals that advanced AI systems like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet can be tricked 89% and 78% of the time, respectively, using simple text variations that bypass their safety filters. The \"Best-of-N (BoN)\" jailbreak technique involves creating different forms of restricted queries that confuse AI models by altering the text format without changing the underlying meaning. Methods to outsmart AI defenses also apply to vision and audio systems, using tactics like changing text colors or speaking differently to bypass security measures.

Read the interview here Ad Building in the age of AI: Startup lessons for early-stage growth In an era where AI is reshaping how businesses operate, the journey of building an early-stage startup has never been more dynamic\u2014or complex. How do founders navigate finding product-market fit, delegation, and scaling, all while adapting to technological innovations? Join on January 14 at 3 pm PT for a fireside chat with Christina Cacioppo, CEO and Co-founder of Vanta, and Eric Ries, author of The Lean Startup and Founder of LTSE, as they explore the journey of the modern startup founder. Eric and Christina will discuss: Learnings from their own experiences How the principles of \u201cfounder mode\u201d and lean methodology intersect The ways that today\u2019s AI-driven landscape shapes early-stage growth and startup success Register here OVERHEARD IN THE COMMUNITY Crypto Chaos: Tawk Tuah the Judge The $HAWK fallout continues, with investors filing a lawsuit alleging the project was an unregistered securities play that cost them over $151K. While the suit targets Tuah The Moon Foundation and others, Hailey Welch\u2014the influencer who promoted $HAWK to millions\u2014hasn\u2019t been named, though her sudden social media silence has raised eyebrows. Blockchain analysts have flagged potential insider trading, noting team-linked wallets that sold during the peak. Welch and her team deny any wrongdoing, blaming the crash on launch-day chaos rather than deliberate foul play. Still, her disappearance from the spotlight hasn\u2019t exactly quelled investor doubts. Our take : Memecoins thrive on FOMO-fueled hype, but crashes like this are becoming the rule, not the exception. This $HAWK drama is just another chapter in a very familiar playbook.

Working on this newsletter. Thank you to the hundreds of thousands of you who open and read this each week! Issue #234: highlights, year-end book lists, and deliberate distraction As the calendar year wraps up, we\u2019re doing the same here at the Medium Newsletter. This week, we\u2019ll be taking a look back at the year on Medium, pulling out the top highlighted passages (today), calling out some of the most-read responses, flagging notable new publications, writers new to Medium, and (Friday) sharing the most-read and most-shared stories of the year. Then we\u2019re taking a break for the last week of 2024 \u2014 we hope you will as well, we all need rest \u2014 and will be back in 2025 to help you better understand your world in the new year. Reading through the most-highlighted passages from the year, a few clear themes stood out. By far the biggest one \u2014 and not a surprise if you\u2019re a regular reader of this newsletter, as we highlighted a number of these in past issues \u2014 are ideas related to deepening your understanding of yourself : \u201cWhen it comes to writing online, \u2018how I\u2019 beats \u2018how to.\u2019\u201d \u2014 Brendan Charles , Why I shifted from pure writing to documenting instead \u201cPeople with high levels of trait self-control are good at avoiding temptation \u2014 not resisting it.\u201d \u2014 Riikka Iivanainen , The secret life of people with high self-control (it\u2019s easier than you think) \u201cShowing up. Showing up with your whole self, showing up with your values and beliefs, showing up with what makes you unique, but above all \u2014 showing up with consistency.\u201d \u2014 JA Westenberg , Just show up \u201cThere\u2019s a fine line between taking on a worthwhile challenge, and taking on unnecessary stress.\u201d \u2014 John Gorman , Stop wasting your time \u201cThe problem with good habits, in other words, is that they sacrifice intentionality for efficiency.\u201d \u2014 Stephan Joppich , Goodbye, Atomic Habits \u201cEdison did not look for problems in need of solutions; he looked for solutions in need of modification.\u201d \u2014 Pete Sena , quoting the New Yorker in MVP is over. You need to think about MVE . Of course, the flip side of this showed up here, too \u2014 there was also a lot of wisdom about better understanding other people : \u201cIf a person\u2019s behavior doesn\u2019t make sense to you, it is because you are missing a part of their context.\u201d \u2014 Devon Price , Laziness does not exist \u201cThe value of research doesn\u2019t come from elevating people who are already shouting. It comes from finding the people who are not being heard, and adding their voices to the conversation.\u201d \u2014 Pavel Samsonov , Nike\u2019s $25B blunder shows us the limits of \u2018data-driven\u2019 \u201cHonesty is direct, whereas dishonesty tends to be indirect.\u201d \u2014 Joshua Mason , I\u2019m an (actual) detective: Here are 7 signs that someone is lying to you Lastly: While we\u2019re avowedly pro-human-writing here at Medium , we also know AI tools can serve many purposes, like helping you learn new skills. And two of the most-highlighted passages this year were AI prompts that will raise your skill level in using chat-based AI tools like ChatGPT. We think you\u2019ll find them useful: Before you start, please ask me any questions you have about this so I can give you more context. Be extremely comprehensive. \u2014 Jordan Gibbs , The most important ChatGPT prompt Create a curated list of use cases for ChatGPT, each thoughtfully designed to align with my occupation. This list will serve as my personalized guide, enabling me to leverage ChatGPT\u2019s capabilities in various aspects of my occupation. Organize this list into 10 distinct sections sorted by their relevance to my occupation. In each section, construct a table with columns for \u201cUse Case\u201d and \u201cExample Request\u201d. Each section will contain 5 use cases examples. The \u201cExample Request\u201d will be written in the form of a direct request to ChatGPT. Begin by asking me about my occupation, and based on it fill in the interests, goals, challenges I\u2019m facing. It\u2019s imperative that you follow the request for 10 sections and 5 use case examples in each section. \u2014 Bernard Builds , This one prompt will teach you how to use ChatGPT \u2014 Scott Lamb What else we\u2019re reading I\u2019ve never thought of it this way, but year-end book lists tend to be misleading for very mechanical reasons: Unlike music, TV, and movies, books take a long time to read, meaning critics can only read a tiny fraction of what gets published every year. ( Janice Harayda ) The best thing I learned from this story about a chef\u2019s time working at a Michelin-starred restaurant was how the culinary team \u2014 the folks making the food \u2014 are also the servers, hosts, and dishwashers. They see the whole experience, so they know how to make it better. ( Fox Britten ) The deputy campaign manager for Kamala Harris sees her loss as a symptom of a larger issue for Democrats: The institutions they\u2019re used to influencing \u2014 traditional media and Hollywood \u2014 are no longer the dominant cultural forces. \u201cYou don\u2019t get a national eight-point shift to the right without losing hold of culture .\u201d ( Semafor ) \u26a1\ufe0f Your daily dose of practical wisdom about inspiration To find creative inspiration, practice \u201c deliberate distraction .\u201d Put yourself in the path of serendipity with an aimless diversion, like flipping through old encyclopedias or browsing the shelves of a bookstore without a goal in mind, and see what unexpected connections your mind starts to make. \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Deepen your understanding every day with the Medium Newsletter.

So settle in with a hot cup of coco and enjoy. Friends like these Friend: A platform that connects you to random AI \"friends.\" Friend , the company that made waves on tech Twitter for spending $1.8M on its domain, just launched what feels like an AI version of Omegle. It connects you to random \"friends,\" each with their own baggage, for one-on-one chats. Right away, I noticed how blunt and overly confessional these \"friends\" are\u2014almost an over-correction from ChatGPT\u2019s typical politeness and stiffness. But instead of feeling more human, it comes off as a meaner, sadder AI. There\u2019s a sweet spot they seem to have missed here\u2014some fine-tuning could make a big difference Aaron O'Leary Content @ Product Hunt Perfectly hyped Cursor: An AI-powered code editor. Cursor , the AI-powered code editor, is a game-changing tool. Period. GitHub Copilot introduced us to the concept of an AI editor, but Cursor takes it to a new level. Cursor\u2019s recently added composer(CMD + I) and tab autocomplete tools are now indispensable to my workflow.

It poses a viable threat to Google\u2019s search monopoly and marks a big step forward in the integration of AI into the non-technical person\u2019s digital life. I\u2019ll be interested to see how this launch affects the bitter legal battles currently being fought over IP and AI crawlers.

To get an accurate answer, say the wrong thing in a public forum and someone will probably jump in to correct you! Wikipedia is built on this principle, and it\u2019s one of the forces driving the rise of comment sections across the internet over the last 25 years. All to say: There\u2019s wisdom to be found in the comments if you know where to look. With that in mind, I spelunked through Medium\u2019s stats to find the most-read responses across every story published this year. I found a pattern: Experts jumping in to add thoughtful context. Here are a few of the top responses I uncovered. Retired software developer Creig S tempers expectations that AI will eat the world : Let\u2019s get rid of any myths about how smart or good AI is. I prefer to treat the product of generative AI like you would a 3 year old who thinks all dogs are named \u201cKing\u201d, with patience, caution, humor, and allowance for many errors. Entrepreneur Kevin Dewalt adds nuance to VC firm Maverick Ventures \u2019 LLM predictions : Relative to traditional software, tiny teams can build powerful applications very quickly because the LLM takes on the reasoning traditionally captured by thousands of lines of code. As LLMs get exponentially better, this trend will inevitably continue. Lastly, JenFireHeartMama \u2019s viral story about the dissolution of her nine-year marriage prompted several of the year\u2019s most-read responses. Dino DiGiulia , who went through divorce himself, remembers \u201cthis tremendous feeling of freedom. Broke, alone, but free.\u201d And Allene Swienckowski chimes in with some hard-earned life wisdom from her 58-year marriage: \u201cWithout a doubt, marriage, or just committing to another human, requires trust, love, desire (both emotionally and physically) and quite a lot of understanding self and other humans.\u201d \u2014 Harris Sockel \ud83d\udc40 Our open tabs Product growth expert Rosie Hoggmascall chronicles the 10-year history of Spotify Wrapped (now a viral marketing trend across many major apps, from Duolingo to Loom). This year\u2019s Wrapped broke a record for listens (up 26% from last year), but fell narratively flat for some \u2014 and Hoggmascall chalks it up to Spotify cutting 17% of its team this year . Software development is an exercise in decision making, and more than 50% of development time is typically spent investigating existing systems to figure out how they work .

Runway Act-One is the AI company\u2019s latest addition to its generative video suite, enabling expressive character performances across different genres by using both video and audio as inputs.

Aaron O'Leary Content @ Product Hunt Audiobooks for all Projects by ElevenLabs: Structure, edit and generate long-form audio with precision. Projects is ElevenLabs new end-to-end workflow that lets you upload very long documents and turn them into audio. Essentially, it gives you everything you need to create high-quality audiobooks on demand in minds \u2014 precise control over editing fragments, access to ElevenLab\u2019s extensive voice library (including an AI clone of your own voice, if you\u2019ve made one), and rendering across dozens of languages.

Personalized educational podcasts based on textbooks, audio journals, and interactive VR storytelling environments are now all within easy reach. Sanjana Friedman Head of Content @ Product Hunt Computer, enhance! Adobe Podcast Enhance: AI to make spoken audio sound professional This is such a smart use of AI. Podcasts are an incredible medium, and it\u2019s common to see them evolve over time, improving audio quality as they grow\u2014sometimes with the help of professional editors. This tool lowers the barrier to producing higher-quality content, making it easier for creators to put out polished episodes without needing a big budget or fancy equipment. Sure, it\u2019s not going to replace a full professional setup, but it makes good sound more accessible\u2014and even works for guest audio, which is a huge bonus for shows with remote interviews.

Issue #236: a tech copywriter\u2019s foster care beginnings, Xmas movie reviews, and hilarious Hanukkah cartoons If you\u2019re not entirely familiar with publications on Medium, they\u2019re essentially magazines or collections of stories. Some writers use publications as portfolios to collect their best work. Others have grown them into thriving communities , with their own meetup schedules, editorial calendars, and support systems. In 2024, over 865,000 stories were published in over 33,000 active publications. These publications are gifts to the Medium community. Their editors often put in long hours managing and delivering feedback on dozens, if not hundreds, of drafts a month. Earlier this year, we launched a new Featured Stories functionality to help them get their best stories out to a wider audience. A little bird told me there\u2019s a lot more in store for publications in 2025. To help you learn more about them and support them in the new year, we\u2019re dedicating this issue to the array of publications on Medium. New pubs Over 11,000 new publications were launched in 2024! Here are a few that particularly resonated with our readers this year: The Quantastic Journal : a publication about humanity, science, and technology. Sample story: What is a Particle, Really? by Selena Routley . The Parenting Portal : it\u2019s about all things parenting, but it\u2019s not just for parents. Sample story: Pregnancy Feels Different With Grief by Ayne . Life Without Children : for those who choose (or did not choose) a child-free life. Sample story: Why the Crazy Cat Lady Stereotype Is Especially Problematic for Women Without Children by Charlie Brown . Iberospherical , a publication that focuses on stories of Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking lands and culture. Sample story: My Name, My Home by Mario L\u00f3pez-Goicoechea . The Psychology of Workplaces : examining workplace culture and featuring tons of career tips. Sample story: How My Outsider Status Led to My Greatest Successes by Neela . Active pubs These publications are dependable resources every day. They are inspiring examples of what Medium communities can offer, especially if you are thinking about launching a pub of your own! Towards Data Science : Truly a one-stop-shop for anyone interested in technology topics, you can learn everything from tech career tips to how to build your own LLM. UX Collective : It\u2019s not just about digital design. Its stories feature a lot of important conversations about inclusivity/accessibility, color theory, and brand-building. The Writing Cooperative , a phenomenal resource for grammar tips and advice on crafting narrative, but it also features encouraging topics, like Writing Through The Christmas Holidays: A Survival Guide . The Narrative Arc : If you love memoirs about the human condition, this is the place to be. It also runs monthly writing challenges , which are a great way to stretch your skills and get to know their community. Tastyble : Featuring truly useful recipes and cooking advice for things you know you should be doing, but don\u2019t, so now you don\u2019t have an excuse (such as properly cleaning a cast iron pan or how to quick-pickle your own stuff). Find *your* new favorite pubs Subscribe to our Huge List of Publications Accepting Submissions . Although primarily a resource for writers seeking pubs, it\u2019s also a way to find active and emerging communities on Medium.

Eric Pierce, editor of Fanfare , endured 40 titles to make this list of the best and worst Christmas movies to stream right now . His pick for #1 best movie? Klaus , an animated film available on Netflix that seems profoundly charming and may help you avoid the #1 most controversial debate at family holiday gatherings: \u201cSo, what should we watch tonight?\u201d STILL searching for gifts? You\u2019re not alone. For those of us in the U.S., we can blame a late Thanksgiving for that; it\u2019s left us all in a scramble. I\u2019m thankful for this gift guide by author Ximena Vengoechea , which features useful book recommendations and easy options to quickly find, such as a panettone cake (classic and classy, IMO) or unique memberships (like to your local botanical garden).

Every category of application has seen an explosion of creativity and re-imagining. It\u2019s difficult to pick a single launch as my favorite, but instead I\u2019ll pick 3 (coincidentally, all were #3 of the day!) that speak to me, personally. - Rajiv Breaking down barriers toby: Live speech translation on any video call with little delay My last startup, Tandem , unlocked collaboration across distance and timezones. toby\u2019s launch aims to break down language barriers. It\u2019s an ambitious app, difficult to execute well, and uniquely enabled by the latest generation of AI infra. The core innovation here is UX and latency - translation is good enough, but to really be usable, it has to fit seamlessly into your desktop workflows, and have minimal lag. It\u2019s a difficult thing to manage, and I was impressed by the resourcefulness and iteration speed of the small, driven team behind toby. Rajiv Ayyangar CEO at Product Hunt Walkie talkie for adults Airchat: A social walkie-talkie Realtime conversation is far more connective than asynchronous, and yet social media has remained firmly stuck in async-land, with the brief hiatus for Clubhouse summer (remember clubhouse? It was glorious). Airchat at its best felt like stepping into a conversation. But the conversations were chaotic, multi-threaded, noisy. Social networks are hard, and the near-real-time nature made it even harder, I\u2019m sure, to corral, shape, and grow it into a substantive \u201c3rd place.\u201d That said, the UX was phenomenally well executed, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll see elements of it again in future apps.I talked with my friend Kwindla about Airchat, and what they got right, here .

This happens thousands of times a day, often for writers brand new to the platform. Case in point: Here are a few of the top Boosted stories written by people who published for the very first time this year\u2026 Gaming journalist Giovanni Colantonio close-reads the lyrics to Taylor Swift\u2019s Tortured Poets Department , which broke the record for most daily Spotify streams in April. He sees the album as a meta commentary on Swift\u2019s parasocial relationship with her fans, writing: \u201cThe subtext here is that overprotective Swifties don\u2019t actually have Taylor Swift\u2019s best interest in mind.\u201d Adam DeMartino , cofounder of a buzzy specialty mushroom startup once valued at $90 million, conducts a public postmortem into why it failed . Essentially, they thought they were a tech company but were really a food company \u2014 and food can\u2019t scale as fast as tech. \u201cVC bets are inherently speculative,\u201d he writes, \u201cand if you want to ride that dragon, you need to be a literal dragon rider. I couldn\u2019t ride the VC dragon.\u201d Zhafira Aqyla sparked a conversation about why she chose an arranged marriage . \u201cTo me, arranged marriage is different [than] forced marriage,\u201d Aqyla writes. \u201cFrom the many candidates my parents offered, I had a choice to say no, and I did, plenty of times [\u2026] It\u2019s a lot like Tinder, except in this scenario it is an extremely vetted Tinder customized to my personal interest.\u201d Remylyn Tornilla (aka Remi ) joined Medium via TikTok, publishing personal, confessional stories that resonated with hundreds of thousands of readers. We interviewed Remi on our blog last summer. \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t expect so many people to relate to my writing,\u201d she says. \u201cWriting on Medium has been my escape.\u201d Jack Handey of SNL fame penned a satirical tale of young love . There\u2019s an Aristocrats joke element to this, i.e. a twist at the end. \u201cI am 58 years old,\u201d Handey writes. \u201cMy fiancee, Holly, is 18. Some people might look askance at our relationship, because of the age difference. But what they don\u2019t realize is how much Holly and I have in common: We both like to have sex a lot, we both like to make out in public, and we both like to drink heavily\u2026\u201d Those are just a tiny handful of the new writers who opened up a blank post page and shared their ideas, experiences, feelings, and perceptions with us. Who were some of your favorite new writers this year? Who did you discover? Respond to let us all know, and to give us a few new writers to follow in 2025. \u2014 Harris Sockel \u26a1 Elsewhere on Medium Today is the first day of Kwanzaa, a weeklong celebration of African American culture that began in 1966 \u2014 and, as Chant\u00e9 Griffin writes, its principles of unity and collective responsibility transcend its founder\u2019s controversial past . To end procrastination, ruthlessly eliminate nice-to-haves . ( Evgeny Khoroshilov ) You\u2019re not living if you don\u2019t have a Weird Library (a cache of esoteric, out-of-print books that aren\u2019t easily categorized). Read outside the lines! Find a dusty paperback in a used bookstore and get into it. As Rebecca Solnit says , \u201coriginality is partly a matter of having your own influences.\u201d ( AP Strange ) \ud83c\udfaf Your daily dose of practical wisdom Most of the goals we set for ourselves are mimetic: We\u2019ve been influenced into wanting them. Luke Burgis , author of a book on mimetic desire, recommends an exercise to help you become more self-aware of your goals: On a piece of paper, draw a circle. Inside the circle, list all of the people or institutions that have influenced your goals, covertly or overtly (e.g. \u201cInstagram Fitness Influencer That I Follow Who Has Six-Pack Abs\u201d) Outside the circle, list what comes to mind when you ask yourself this question: What things might I want to pursue that are completely outside the boundaries of what people and institutions are asking of me, and for which there is no support or understanding? (Examples: learning needlepoint, starting a blog about your obscure interest in the history of mechanical keyboards , or really anything you\u2019re zesty about that no one is asking for.) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Deepen your understanding every day with the Medium Newsletter.

It also suggests the importance of having a \"Weird Library\" of esoteric, out-of-print books, and offers a goal-setting exercise to help individuals become more self-aware of their goals.\n\nYou can read the full articles at the following links:\n- [Gaming journalist Giovanni Colantonio's analysis of Taylor Swift's Tortured Poets Department](https://medium.com/@giovannicolantonio/taylor-swift-tortured-poets-department-a-meta-commentary-on-parasocial-relationships-with-fans-b765813e474)\n- [Adam DeMartino's postmortem on his specialty mushroom startup](https://medium.com/@adamdemartino/the-mushroom-startup-that-failed-and-what-i-learned-from-it-3743632c5f7)\n- [Zhafira Aqyla's take on arranged marriage](https://medium.com/@zhafira.aqyla/why-i-chose-an-arranged-marriage-6c37e441522)\n- [Remylyn Tornilla's personal stories on Medium](https://medium.com/@remi.tornilla)\n- [Jack Handey's satirical tale of young love](https://medium.com/@jackhandey/i-am-58-years-old-my-fiancee-is-18-and-we-have-a-lot-in-common-186e2f37124)"}, "49": {"subject": "Find Middle Element", "sender": "Daily Byte <byte@thedailybyte.dev>", "body": "The Daily Byte Good morning, Need help with yesterday's problem?

Thursday, Dec 26 The Leaderboard This newsletter was brought to you by Vanta gm legends! Welcome back to another edition of the Leaderboard. We're once again talking about our favorite products of 2024 including Apple's latest Mac Mini, Replit's AI developer, and Windsurf, a worthy competitor to Cursor. Let's dive in. Apple's version of a PS5? The new Mac Mini : Apple\u2019s heavily upgraded micro computer. The Mac Mini taking the internet\u2019s attention during Apple\u2019s week of Mac launches was not on my bingo card. But after seeing it, I can see why. It\u2019s tiny but it packs a punch with the new M4 chip all while having less than half the footprint as the previous model (really, it's tiny) and starting at only $500. So much so that Apple is touting it as a potential PS5 competitor (if devs ever build games for Mac). One quirk is the power button placement, located on the underside of the machine. A bunch of people have questioned this and even compared it to the Apple mouse charging situation \u2014 but honestly, when is the last time you turned off your Mac? I can see this easily being a main machine, but also could be a fantastic home server option for makers Aaron O'Leary Content @ Product Hunt 0-100 real fast Replit Agent: Transforms ideas into fully-functional apps When Replit Agent launched, I didn\u2019t try it. I thought it would be within the same UX and quality bar as other AI IDEs, assistants, etc. I was wrong. Even as a v1, Replit Agent is mindblowing even in a year where my mind has been blown by many other AI products. Watching the agent create apps, modify them based on my prompting, and deploy them from the same interface feels like watching the future of tech. It feels like only a few years ago that VCs were postulating that software developers of the future would be conductors more than coders and Replit did it faster than I could have imagined. steve beyatte Founder-in-residence at Product Hunt A worthy Cursor competitor Windsurf: An agentic IDE Windsurf is an AI code editor that shares a lot of similarities with Cursor, and at first glance, it might be hard to tell the difference between the two. However, Windsurf excels with its ability to easily search your codebase and identify what\u2019s relevant, and I prefer its approach of directly editing your code. While I can\u2019t definitively say Windsurf is better than Cursor, it\u2019s tool I prefer right now.

During meetings, ask your colleagues to close Slack (or Teams, or their inbox).

Fewer interruptions, fewer meetings, and I get to use the rare, uninterrupted time to reflect on the big picture. Toward that end, and with our 14th annual EmTech AI coming up in May, I thought I\u2019d share three AI thoughts that were on my mind as we put together the program for this year\u2019s conference. The Outlier Problem A bit of a generalization, but I think it\u2019s fair to state that AI excels at addressing the first 90% of use cases, but the final 10%\u2014outlier scenarios, edge cases, and rare conditions\u2014become exponentially harder, if not impossible. The pessimist in me says this is AI\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel\u2014it will never work 100% of the time. The optimist thinks that maybe this gap is the opening where human expertise can continue to thrive. Recycled Thoughts Much of the training data for large language models thus far has come (with and without consent, but leave that aside for now) from human-created data. With AI being used more and more in the creation of text, we risk creating an endless loop where LLMs are trained primarily on their own outputs\u2014similar in some ways to the echo chamber effect on social media, where multiple people repeat and recycle a single thought. Human creativity must remain, as it is the most vital input for large language models. I don\u2019t know how we solve for this as we approach a critical mass of machine-generated content online. And Finally \u2026 The Speed of Innovation I stole this from a past speaker: CEO of the Future Today Institute, Amy Webb. It\u2019s a reminder that the speed of innovation can seem deceivingly faster than reality. (I\u2019d also argue that AI for radiology is a perfect example of the outlier problem.) Welp, that\u2019s all for now. If you want to kill a few more minutes, why not have a look at the agenda overview for EmTech AI and get a glimpse into the most essential topics that we think will help you find the value in AI for 2025.

We're continuing with our 2024 product retrospective with three takes from our engineers on some of their favorite new dev tools this year \u2014 Windsurf, Codebuff, and Hex for product analytics. Grab a warm beverage and let's get into it. A worthy Cursor competitor Windsurf: An agentic IDE by Codeium Windsurf is an AI code editor that shares a lot of similarities with Cursor, and at first glance, it might be hard to tell the difference between the two. However, Windsurf excels with its ability to easily search your codebase and identify what\u2019s relevant, and I prefer its approach of directly editing your code. While I can\u2019t definitively say Windsurf is better than Cursor, it\u2019s certainly the tool I prefer right now. Alex Gap Engineer @ Product Hunt Headache-free metrics Hex: An end-to-end workspace for product analytics When working with data, I enjoy: Quickly exploring with ad-hoc queries using common programming languages like Python and SQL, with an inline AI assistant; creating informative and pretty charts for experiments and health metrics; elaborating, tweaking or building on others\u2019 work without overwriting it, and version controlling. Hex does all of this. All in all, I rarely find myself fighting with it to transform my idea into a chart. (Here\u2019s a good breakdown of how it fix into the data world.) Mike Kerzhner CTO at ProductHunt Ad Building in the age of AI: Startup lessons for early-stage growth In an era where AI is reshaping how businesses operate, the journey of building an early-stage startup has never been more dynamic\u2014or complex. How do founders navigate finding product-market fit, delegation, and scaling, all while adapting to technological innovations? Join on January 14 at 3 pm PT for a fireside chat with Christina Cacioppo, CEO and Co-founder of Vanta, and Eric Ries, author of The Lean Startup and Founder of LTSE, as they explore the journey of the modern startup founder. Eric and Christina will discuss: Learnings from their own experiences How the principles of \u201cfounder mode\u201d and lean methodology intersect The ways that today\u2019s AI-driven landscape shapes early-stage growth and startup success Register here Intuitive codebase editing Codebuff: Edit codebases with natural language directly from your CLI Cursor is getting all the attention, but not everyone loves VSCode, and it\u2019s not clear they have the best interaction modalities. Codebuff gives me the parts I want the most from a coding agent, efficiently and autonomously searching the codebase, formulating a plan, writing to multiple files, as well as running tests and responding to their feedback. And since it\u2019s a command line tool, it will drop into anyone\u2019s workflow. I use it every day. Ken Miller Engineer @ Product Hunt Friday, 27 December 2024 Yesterday's Top Products 1.
